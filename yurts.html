            <strong>What is a yurt?</strong>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. 
            Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, a roof dome 
            that can be opened, and a private deck.

        <dd>
            Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king-size bed with down quilt, comfy couch, 
            dining table and chairs, mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. 
            Your luxury camping experience includes a sink with hot and cold running water. 
            Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

            <strong>What should I bring?</strong>

            Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing. 
            It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
